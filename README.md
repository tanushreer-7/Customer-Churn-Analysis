# üìä Customer Churn Analysis

## üìù Project Overview

Customer Churn Prediction(CCP) is a process of analyzing and predicting the behavior of new and existing customers or software users. This mechanism is important in various industries including telecommunications, Petroleum, Business, and information technology. The ability to predict customer churn is defined as the probability of customers discontinuing a service which can transform risk into opportunities. These include revenue growth, increased customer interaction, build a positive business reputation. This analysis can be done using several machine learning models. In this paper, the models used are Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBOOST, and SVM.

It also highlights the comparative analysis of these models and concludes which model is suitable for achieving optimal results and which model is not suitable. These results or insights can be used by businesses to mitigate customer churn, which will ultimately accelerate revenue growth.

## ‚úÖ Results

* Best model achieved is SVM with **52% accuracy**.
* Top influencing features: *Tenure, Monthly Charges, Contract Type*, etc.
* Insights provided on customer segments more likely to churn.
